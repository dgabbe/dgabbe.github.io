Wow, you really did have more questions.  Short answer is I'm having a bakeoff 
between Rmarkdown and Jekyll for building a static HTML site.

Why no HTTPS connection?  
  ~ Because Github Pages does not offer an HTTPS connection
if you use a custom domain.  I figure this will get solved when browsers force secure 
connections or I can migrate to Gitlab or Amazon S3.

Jekyll vs Rmarkdown:

Github vs Amazon S3 hosting:
