### Welcome

This site is an experiment building a static site with [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html).  My old web 
site with all the photographs is still [around](http://www.frame38.com).

I'm not a blogger per se, but I decided to give back to the community as other people's blogs
were and are tremenously helpful towards enabling my progress.  And before
going any further, my posts tend to be around the R ecosystem.

### Why Rmarkdown For a Blog?

My intial plan was to post articles on LinkedIn, but those articles may not 
include HTML code and there's no way to generate anywhere near as nicely formatted 
R code or even generate sections with R code.

WordPress seems like overkill for my needs and I didn't want the sysadmin hassles.

Github will host static sites for free and has a huge benefit.  I can publish my
package documentation automatically using
[`pkgdown`](https://github.com/hadley/pkgdown#pkgdown) directly to this website by
setting *Github Pages* to `Source - master branch/docs folder` under project 
settings.

### Why is a Package Website a Big Deal?

An R package is only useful if people use it.  People will only use it if they
can **easily** check it out, but developers only want to write the
documentation once. As part of building your package, R help files are genereated from your Roxygen comments.  And finally `pkgdown` translates the R help files
into a website.  Now you can browse a website to learn the details of a
package.  Awesome!
